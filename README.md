SmartOnboardAI is a cross-platform, source-adaptive onboarding app built with React Native, Expo, and Gemini AI. It personalizes the onboarding experience based on how users arrive at your app (e.g., Instagram, referral, blog, or direct) and provides analytics and content tailored to each source.

## Features

- **Personalized Onboarding**: Customizes onboarding slides and content for each user source
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Uses Gemini AI for content analysis and recommendations
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks user engagement and source analytics
- **Deep Linking**: Supports UTM parameters and deep links for accurate source tracking
- **Responsive UI**: Works seamlessly on web, iOS, and Android
- **Modern React Native/Expo Stack**: Fast development, easy deployment
