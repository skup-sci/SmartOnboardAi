# SmartOnboardAI

A Source-Adaptive Experience app that leverages AI to personalize content based on where users come from. Built with React Native and Expo, with Gemini AI integration.

## Features

- 🔍 **Intelligent Source Detection**: Automatically detects if users come from Instagram, referrals, blogs, or direct visits
- 🧠 **AI-Powered Personalization**: Uses Gemini AI to analyze content and match it to different user sources
- 📊 **Source Analytics Dashboard**: Track user origins and engagement patterns
- 🎯 **Content Adaptation**: Displays the most relevant content based on where users came from
- 🔄 **Deep Linking**: Complete system to capture and maintain referral sources
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and web

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env file and add your API keys

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on iOS
npm run ios

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on web
npm run web
```

## Environment Variables

This app requires API keys for its functionality. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

For security reasons, never commit your `.env` file to version control. The app uses secure storage to protect API keys on device.
