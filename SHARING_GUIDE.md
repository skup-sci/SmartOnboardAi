# ðŸš€ How to Share SmartOnboardAI App Publicly

## Option 1: Expo Development Build (Recommended for Testing)

### Quick Share via QR Code
1. **Start the Expo server** (already running):
   ```powershell
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Share the QR code** that appears in your terminal/browser
   - Anyone with the Expo Go app can scan and test your app
   - Works on both iOS and Android devices

3. **Get the public URL**:
   - Look for the URL in your terminal (e.g., `exp://192.168.x.x:8081`)
   - Share this URL directly with testers

### Enable Tunnel Mode for External Access
```powershell
npx expo start --tunnel
```
This creates a public URL that works from anywhere on the internet.
