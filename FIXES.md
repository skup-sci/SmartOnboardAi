## Fixed: Navigation Error

### Problem
The app was encountering a navigation error: "The action navigate with payload was not handled by any navigator" when trying to navigate from tab screens (Home, Discover, Profile) to stack screens (ContentDetail, Analytics, Settings).

### Root Cause
In React Navigation v6, when navigating from a nested navigator (tab navigator) to a screen in the parent navigator (stack navigator), you need to access the parent navigator explicitly.

### Solution
1. **Updated navigation calls in tab screens:**
   - Changed `navigation.navigate('ContentDetail', { contentId })` to `navigation.getParent()?.navigate('ContentDetail', { contentId })`
   - Changed `navigation.navigate('Analytics')` to `navigation.getParent()?.navigate('Analytics')`
   - Changed `navigation.navigate('Settings')` to `navigation.getParent()?.navigate('Settings')`

2. **Enabled Analytics screen:**
   - Uncommented the Analytics screen in the navigation stack
   - Now all navigation paths are properly configured

3. **Fixed affected screens:**
   - `HomeScreen.tsx`: Fixed ContentDetail and Analytics navigation
   - `DiscoverScreen.tsx`: Fixed ContentDetail navigation
   - `ProfileScreen.tsx`: Fixed Analytics and Settings navigation

### Files Modified
- `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/DiscoverScreen.tsx` 
- `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`

## Fixed: Gemini Model 404 Errors and Navigator Issues

### Problem
1. **Gemini API 404 Error**: The service was trying to use `gemini-pro` which returns 404 errors as it's not available in the current API version
2. **Navigator Format Error**: React Navigation was throwing an error about invalid children due to formatting issues in the navigation configuration

### Root Cause
1. **Outdated Model Names**: The Gemini API has updated model names, and `gemini-pro` is no longer available in v1beta
2. **JSX Formatting**: Improper formatting in the Stack.Navigator component was causing parsing issues

### Solution
1. **Updated Model List**:
   - Changed primary models to `gemini-1.5-flash` (fastest, most cost-effective)
   - Added `gemini-1.5-pro` and `gemini-1.0-pro` as fallbacks
   - Included alternative naming conventions with `models/` prefix
   - Removed duplicates and cleaned up the model selection logic

2. **Fixed Navigator Formatting**:
   - Properly formatted the Stack.Navigator JSX structure
   - Fixed indentation and line breaks for proper parsing

### Files Modified
- `src/services/geminiService.ts`: Updated model names and cleaned up duplicates
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`: Fixed JSX formatting issues

## Fixed: `TypeError: window.addEventListener is not a function`

### Problem
The app was encountering a `TypeError: window.addEventListener is not a function` error because React Native does not have the same browser-like `window` object that web applications do. The error was specifically occurring in the `GeminiService` class, which was attempting to use browser-specific APIs in a React Native environment.

### Solution
1. **Replaced browser-specific code with React Native alternatives**
   - Removed `window.addEventListener('online', ...)` calls
   - Added `@react-native-community/netinfo` package for network state monitoring
   - Implemented platform-specific code to handle both web and mobile environments

2. **Improved service lifecycle management**
   - Added proper cleanup for event listeners to prevent memory leaks
   - Initialized services as React refs in AppContext for better lifecycle management
   - Added conditional imports to handle environments where certain APIs might not be available

3. **Enhanced error handling**
   - Added more robust error catching around network operations
   - Implemented fallbacks for when network monitoring isn't available
   - Added proper cleanup functions to unsubscribe from event listeners

## Fixed: Gemini API Quota and Model Issues

### Problem
The GeminiService was experiencing frequent quota limit errors and model availability issues, causing the AI features to fail repeatedly.

### Solution
1. **Model Selection Strategy**
   - Updated model list to use correct model names that avoid 404 errors
   - Implemented fallback model hierarchy with quota-aware selection
   - Removed test API calls during initialization to preserve quota

2. **Quota Management**
   - Added static methods to track and detect quota issues across app instances
   - Implemented exponential backoff with longer delays (10-120 seconds) for quota-related failures
   - Added 30-minute final retry for quota resets

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Created ApiStatusBanner component to show quota limit warnings
   - Enhanced fallback behavior when AI features are unavailable
   - Added graceful degradation for all AI-dependent features

## Additional Fixes

### Cleaned Up Duplicate Code
- Removed duplicate ApiStatusBanner components in DiscoverScreen
- Fixed import inconsistencies throughout the codebase
- Simplified component structure and removed unused state variables

### Enhanced Service Management
- Used React refs in AppContext for consistent service instances
- Added proper cleanup logic to prevent memory leaks
- Improved error handling and retry mechanisms

---

## Testing Results
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ No runtime errors detected
- ✅ All import statements properly resolved
- ✅ NetInfo integration working correctly
- ✅ API status monitoring functional
- ✅ Quota handling mechanisms in place
- ✅ Navigation error resolved - all screen transitions working
- ✅ Updated Gemini models to use current API versions
- ✅ Navigator formatting issues fixed

The app is now stable and ready for development/testing with proper fallbacks for AI feature limitations and fully functional navigation between all screens.
